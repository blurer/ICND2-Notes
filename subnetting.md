# Easy how to subnet:

HOW TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF HOSTS PER SUBMIT AND SUBMIT 

172.16.0.0/23

1. WRITE THE MASK IN BINARY:
``/23 = 11111111.11111111.11111110.00000000``

2. REMOVE THE NETWORK BITS FROM THE MASK. 
- SINCE THIS IS A CLASS B NETWORK, REMOVE THE FIRST 16 BITS.

``11111110.000000000``

3. COUNT THE NUMBER OF 1'S 

TAKE THAT NUMBER CALCULATE TO THE 2^N WHERE N = 1'S

``2^7 = 128 SUBNETS``

4. COUNT THE NUMBER OF 0'S

TAKE THAT NUMBER CALCULATE TO THE (2^N)-2 WHERE N = 0'S

``(2^9=512)-2 =510``

## Answer
```
SUBNETS=128
HOSTS PER SUBMNET=510
```
